On July 9th, orca calls closely related to Springers’ were detected moving towards Johnstone Strait, and Springer’s best opportunity for success arose. The next day, the A11 matriline pod appeared in the strait, Springer’s extended family, and Springer herself was made ready to move on July 13th. She was lifted from the water and placed in a specially constructed pool on the deck of a catamaran for what would be a 13 hour journey north towards her family. When Springer reached her new seapen in Johnstone Strait, it was not known how long she may need to get used to the new conditions, but she immediately fed, breached, pushed at the net, and made calls to her relatives nearby. In fact, her calls were so vigorous and so clearly her interacting with the other orcas, that the decision was made to release Springer the next day, and at 3:30pm, July 14th, Springer swam straight towards her relatives. ")]),n("p",{staticClass:"my-8"},[e._v(" Perhaps a little surprised to see and hear from a lost calf after 6 months, the pod was not sure how to react. Springer trailed the pod for a few days, likely unable to quite keep up after not traveling long distances for months. Eventually, Springer began traveling closely with the A4 pod, her mother’s closest relatives, and formed bonds with several orcas in the pod. Nodales, A51, who had lost her own calf previously, was seen guiding Springer away from boats as a mother orca would. Springer was also seen often with two other older females, Nawitti, and Yakat who is Springer’s great aunt. It seems that all three of these orcas took on surrogate mother roles for Springer, and after she was seen visiting rubbing beaches with her pod, it was clear that the reintroduction had been an unparalleled success.

After at least 6 months out of her pod with no caregiver and presumed dead, overcoming health issues and huge social isolation, Springer had returned to the wild and contributed two of her own calves to her pod.

This would mean capturing Springer, treating her health conditions, helping her reach a healthy weight, transporting her to a spot where she could reach her familial pod, and being accepted by the pod when she found them.

Springer was fed around 30kg of live salmon each day, sometimes medicated, specially delivered down a chute to her pen so that she never associated human interaction with feeding. After a nervous wait, her medical tests returned to show that she was healthy enough to return to the wild, and after gaining some weight, preparations were made for her big move.
