This is a dangerous pastime in one of the busier shipping lanes in America, and as Springer’s public status grew, she began to show interest in people, and the public began to interact with her. With all the traffic around her, coupled with people beginning to feed her and befriend her, her living situation in Puget Sound was quickly becoming untenable.

The orcas frequenting the area can be identified both by their unique markings and distinct features, but their pods can be identified by their unique vocalisations. Springer had been calling to other orcas in a fashion consistent with the vocalisations of a pod known as the Northern Resident Community. This group of around 215 orcas, was rarely seen in Puget Sound, however it was known that Sutlej, A45, had not returned to this pod with her calf the previous summer, and both were feared dead. Springer was this calf, who through a small miracle was alive, though she was underweight, malnourished, suffering from a skin condition, and was lost in a dangerous place. Something needed to be done for Springer, but it was not clear what that thing should be.

Some wanted to see her in an aquarium, some wanted nature to “take it’s course”, but enough people wanted to see her returned safely to the wild that the decision was made to try and safely release her in a region that she could succeed in. This would mean capturing Springer, treating her health conditions, helping her reach a healthy weight, transporting her to a spot where she could reach her familial pod, and being accepted by the pod when she found them. Any one of these tasks was exceptionally difficult just by itself, and Springer had to do all of them just to have a chance at success in the wild, all while being the equivalent age of a human toddler.

The capture team had a lot of spent time specifically getting her used to the feel of the soft ropes used, the sounds of boats and boat engines, and to some human touch, to keep her as calm as possible for the trials she was about to face. Springer was fed around 30kg of live salmon each day, sometimes medicated, specially delivered down a chute to her pen so that she never associated human interaction with feeding. After a nervous wait, her medical tests returned to show that she was healthy enough to return to the wild, and after gaining some weight, preparations were made for her big move.

On July 9th, orca calls closely related to Springers’ were detected moving towards Johnstone Strait, and Springer’s best opportunity for success arose. The next day, the A11 matriline pod appeared in the strait, Springer’s extended family, and Springer herself was made ready to move on July 13th. She was lifted from the water and placed in a specially constructed pool on the deck of a catamaran for what would be a 13 hour journey north towards her family. When Springer reached her new seapen in Johnstone Strait, it was not known how long she may need to get used to the new conditions, but she immediately fed, breached, pushed at the net, and made calls to her relatives nearby. In fact, her calls were so vigorous and so clearly her interacting with the other orcas, that the decision was made to release Springer the next day, and at 3:30pm, July 14th, Springer swam straight towards her relatives.

Springer trailed the pod for a few days, likely unable to quite keep up after not traveling long distances for months. Eventually, Springer began traveling closely with the A4 pod, her mother’s closest relatives, and formed bonds with several orcas in the pod. Nodales, A51, who had lost her own calf previously, was seen guiding Springer away from boats as a mother orca would. Springer was also seen often with two other older females, Nawitti, and Yakat who is Springer’s great aunt. It seems that all three of these orcas took on surrogate mother roles for Springer, and after she was seen visiting rubbing beaches with her pod, it was clear that the reintroduction had been an unparalleled success.

After at least 6 months out of her pod with no caregiver and presumed dead, overcoming health issues and huge social isolation, Springer had returned to the wild and contributed two of her own calves to her pod.
